-- Development Environment --

To develop ChessFlash I use the free and excellent FlashDevelop from
http://www.flashdevelop.org/
(I am currently using FlashDevelop 3.0.0 RC1)

To use FlashDevelop you will also need (as described at the FlashDevelop site)
  Java JDK 1.6+
  Adobe Flex 3 SDK (I am currently using verions 3.2 / 3.2.0.3958)

  Flash Player ActiveX control content debugger
  Flash Player 10 Projector content debugger
  (I am currently using debugger versions 10.0.12.36.)

Install the Java JDK
Unzip the Flex SDK
Run the Flash Player ActiveX installer
Run the FlashDevelop Installer (the default choices should be fine)

-- Build and Run the ChessFlash Project --

Run FlashDevelop
FlashDevelop Menu: File>Open chessflash.as3proj (in this project).
In project tree: src\chessflash\PgnViewer rightclick and select always compile.
FlashDevelop Menu: Project>Test Movie

The first time you run this, you wil be asked asked to configure AS3 context settings.
In AS3Context settings specify the path to the Adobe Flex 3 SDK unzipped above.

Again, try FlashDevelop Menu: Project>Test Movie.
ChessFlash should be running in your FlashDevelop IDE.

-- Show a real game (pgn file) --

You may want to change the default _pgnUrl in the initialize method of chessflash.PgnViewer 
to point to a valid file (see the comments in the source for some examples) while you are 
running this locally.

-- Unit tests and AsUnit --

You can download the AsUnit Framework from http://sourceforge.net/projects/asunit.
See asunit\readme.txt in this project for more information.

From the AsUnit Frameowrk package, I take the as3 source and add it to my project in 
a directory called asunit.  This will allow you to run the existing unit tests and create 
and run new ones.  Your project folder in FlashDevelop will look something like:

ChessFlash (AS3)
  asunit (if you have downloaded and copied it to your project)
    asunit
	  ...
  bin (created when you build)
  lib
  src
    chessflash
	  ...
  test
    chessflash
       ...
  
If you do add AsUnit source to the project, before you can run the unit tests
you need to tell FlashDevelop to include all source directories (asunit, src, test):
FlashDevelop Menu: Project>Properties>Classpaths

Now you can run the tests in the chessflash.engine package by:
In project tree: test\chessflash\engine\AsUnitTestRunner rightclick and select always compile
FlashDevelop Menu: Project>Test Movie
